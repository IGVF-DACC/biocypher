# BioCypher Tutorial
The main purpose of BioCypher is to facilitate the pre-processing of biomedical
data to save development time in the maintainance of curated knowledge graphs
and to allow the simple and efficient creation of task-specific lightweight
knowledge graphs in a user-friendly and biology-centric fashion.

We are going to use a toy example to familiarise the user with the basic
functionality of BioCypher. One central task of BioCypher is the harmonisation
of dissimilar datasets describing the same entities. Thus, in this example, the
input data - which in the real-world use case could come from any type of
interface - are represented by simulated data containing some examples of
differently formatted biomedical entities such as proteins and their
interactions.
